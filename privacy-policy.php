          <h4>Information Collection and Use Information Collection</h4>
          <p>Evergreen Wellness, LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on <a href="https://myevergreenwellness.com/">myevergreenwellness.com</a>. Our web server automatically recognizes each visitor’s domain address. We also collect aggregate information on what pages our customers access or visit.</p>
          <h4>Information Use</h4>
          <p>We are committed to keeping your e-mail address, mailing address and any other personal information confidential. We do not sell, rent, or lease your information to third parties, and we will not provide your personal information to any third party individual, government agency, or company at any time unless compelled to do so by law. We may, from time to time, send you offers and information associated with our own offerings.</p>
          <h4>Profile</h4>
          <p>We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and user input to create a profile of our users. A profile consists of stored information that we keep on individual users detailing their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users’ personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our website, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share our users’ profiles with third parties.</p>
          <h4>Log Files</h4>
          <p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a Web-based log analyzer to view our site statistics.</p>
          <h4>Sharing Legal Disclaimer</h4>
          <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.</p>
          <h4>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h4>
          <p>We do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners or advertisers.</p>
          <h4>Third Party Intermediaries</h4>
          <p>We use credit card processing companies to bill users for goods and services.</p>
          <h4>Business Transitions</h4>
          <p>In the event Evergreen Wellness, LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
          <h4>Choice/Opt-out</h4>
          <p>Users may choose to opt out at the time of providing their contact information. In addition, users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying with the word “Unsubscribe” in the subject line to the email or emailing us at  <a href="mailto:support@myevergreenwellness.com">support@myevergreenwellness.com</a>.

          <h4>Links</h4>
          <p>This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Evergreen Wellness, LLC is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.</p>
          <h4>Surveys & Contests</h4>
          <p>From time to time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. All of our users’ information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our website administrator or our billing clerk) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected.</p>
          <h4>Correcting/Updating/Deleting Personal Information</h4>
          <p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@myevergreenwellness.com">support@myevergreenwellness.com</a>.</p>
          <h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
          <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email.

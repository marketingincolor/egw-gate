        <p style="text-align:left;">Hi, I’m Jaime Brenkus.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">You may remember me from the 90s when I created a nationwide sensation with my 8-Minute Abs program, and followed that with my 8-Minute Fitness series of videos. My 8-minute programs literally rewrote the book on what can be achieved if you exercise consistently over time!</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">I’m 58 years old now and I’ve started experiencing the challenges myself of what it means to get older. For that reason, I’ve dedicated myself to creating fitness programs suited for people like you and me. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">The program I’m introducing today is the 28-Day Size Down Challenge. A collection of 8-minute daily workouts, combined with healthy meal options, designed to help you lose a size in 28 days. While the 28-Day Size Down Challenge is for those 50 and older, virtually anyone of any age (even beginners) will find plenty of reasons to enjoy it.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Now, you could complete the entire program just doing the exercises and skipping the healthy meal options. And you’re certainly welcome to do that. But if you really want your best chance at losing a size after 28 days, while coming out of this program looking and feeling your best, we recommend you give the healthy meal options a try.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">FirstService Residential has generously allowed me to come into your homes (via the web) for you to try my program and share your thoughts about it after you’ve completed it. Finding time to exercise is the number one reason people are unable to stick with a fitness program. You’re either too busy to exercise or perhaps uncomfortable spending time in a gym. If this describes you, this program is just what you've been looking for. Short, yet effective exercises you can do in the comfort of your home, at your own pace, and according to your schedule.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Now, please check your email and follow the instructions in it. If you find the email in your junk or spam folder, please move it to your regular inbox, as I’ll be communicating with you from time to time throughout the program and would hate for those messages to get lost in your spam!</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Thank you so much for participating in the 28-Day Size Down Challenge - I hope you enjoy the program and stick with it! </p>
